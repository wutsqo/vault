...

To those of you in which I choose to always be the closest to  
Something that you need to know, loving me is not a joke  
You can put it all on me, you can laugh and you can bleed  
And I'll adopt it all because that's just what a buddy does

I loved you from minute one, the iced tea to my lemonade  
Never one to hit-and-run, soaking every minute made  
You can give me all your juice, I can squeeze it out for you  
All I ask you in exchange, love me back through every phase

If it ever comes off wrong or leaves you with a bitter taste  
Just remember you're the tea  
And I'm your sour lemonade, I'm your sour lemonade  
Tropical iced tea and hot pink lemonade
