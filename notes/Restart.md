## Restart
Starting is hard. I always get distracted by the finer, unimportant details. The things like title, css styling, typography, etc., most of the things that don't matter in the end. I always wanted to have a personal blog. Actually, I do have one (or two), and it already filled with some articles about my personal ideas and experiences. 

I used to write weekly notes. Most of which are stored on my private Notion pages. The last time was a few months ago. Now that I'm moving to Obsidian, I find this tool is superior to Notion in terms of notes taking. It is smooth, works offline, and I got full control of my data. It really makes me want to write again.

This piece of writing that you're reading now is a bit different though. It is not necessarily talking about a specific topic or idea. The goal is just to write at least once every week, to build a new habit. Just show up. Rain or shine. Write, and publish.

I'm still not sure what to write about since it is public (at least if you know how to use GitHub). Maybe a commentary of specific events or something interesting I noticed on the day. Maybe ideas, shower thoughts, and a bit of my emotions. I hope by writing regularly I can improve on how I reflect and articulate my way of thinking. Starting to write again, no matter how small it is, is an improvement over doing nothing.
